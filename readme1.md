# Loan Data from Prosper Exploration.

## Dataset

This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.

## Summary of findings.

In my exploration, I found that Borrower APR and Borrower Rate had a strong positive correlation between them which means if borrower APR increases than borrower rate would also increase and if borrower APR decreases than borrower rate would also decrease. Also, in my bivariate analysis I found that their were some features which had both positive and negative affects on the borrower APR for example Borrower APR had moderately negative correlation with the loan original amount. As loan amount increases count of high borrower APR decreases. Also occupation played a major role in  deciding which occupation had higher and lower APR. Also, their was a moderate negative correlation between investors and borrower APR which indicated that while both variables investors and APR tend to went down in response to one another, the relationship was moderately strong.
At the starting of my bivariate analysis when I plotted histograms using pairgrid method I noticed that Borrower APR was not less correlated with credit score feature. Also, their were outliers in credit score lower and upper so I removed them and made a separate column for credit score class by pairing a range of score on the basis of the 'exceptional','Very good','Good','Fair' and 'Poor' credit score. Using violin plot, I saw the negative correlation of APR with credit score class. When the class was 'Exceptional', most of the APR values were less and when class was 'Poor', most of the APR values were high. So, credit score class also played a major role in influencing the APR. In multivariate analysis of APR, Rate and Employment Status, most of the data with the status 'Not Employed' surprisingly had low APR and low rate (below 0.2). But after further analysis it turns out to be that 'Not employed' although had low loan original amount, its debt to income ratio was low for most of the borrowers and also its data is very less. This could be the reason why 'Not Employed' had low APR. Other than these, their were some variables which were weakly correlated with APR for example Debt to income ratio had a weak positive correlation which means that while both variables DTI and APR tend to go up (if APR increase, DTI also increase) in response to one another, the relationship is not very strong. Also, their was a moderate negative correlation between APR and monthly income which indicated that while both variables tend to go down in response to one another, the relationship was not very strong. Maximum borrowers with credit score 'Very Good' and 'Exceptional' had borrower APR and borrower Rate below 0.20. Borrowers with credit score 'Good','Very Good' and 'Exceptional' had high loan amount compare to borrowers who had credit score 'Fair' and 'Poor'. Borrowers with credit score 'Exceptional' and employment status 'Employed' had maximum loan original amount.

## Key Insights for Presentation

In my presentation I mainly focused on the variables which had positive as well as negative affects on Borrower APR, loan status, and loan original amount.
I started my presentation by univariate analysis of the concern variables and left out the variables which were not important for the key insights. After this, I did bivariate analysis by taking two variables one was 'Borrower APR' and other one varied. First I took 'borrower APR' and 'borrower Rate' and plotted a transformed hist2d plot. This plot showed that borrower rate was proportional to borrower APR. Secondly, I took borrower APR' and 'Debt to income ratio' and plotted a transformaed scatter plot and line plot. This plot showed that their was very low positive correlation between the two variables. Third, I took 'borrower APR' and 'stated monthly income' and plotted the same transformed scatter and line plot. This plot showed that their was low negative correlation between the two variables. Fouth, I took 'borrower APR' and 'Occupation', and plotted several line plots for different range of borrower APR. This plot basically showed that which occupation had good APR and which one bad. Fifth, I took 'borrower APR' and 'credit score class' and plotted a violin plot. This plot showed that from 'Poor' credit score to 'Exceptional' credit score, borrower APR decreased.
After doing bivariate analysis, I did multivariate analysis for variables affecting the loan status and loan original amount. First I took Loan Status, Borrower APR and Credit Score Class and plotted a point plot which showed the possibilities of loan status 'Past Due' if APR falls in range 0.14-0.15, 0.20-0.22, 0.24-0.25, 0.27-0.29 for credit score 'exceptional','very good','good','fair','poor'. The point plot also showed that most of the borrowers with credit score of 'Exceptional' and 'Very Good' had APR below 0.20. Secondly, I took Loan original amount, EmploymentStatus, and Credit score and again plotted a point plot. But this time point plot showed that most of the borrowers with 'Exceptional' credit score have had high loan amount some where around $130000. Also, borrowers with other credit scores (except 'good' in which self employed borrowers have had maximum loan amount) with 'Employment' status have had highest loan amount. Last, I took Loan original amount, stated monthly income, credit score class and plotted a hist2d plot which showed that many Borrowers with credit score of 'Exceptional','Very Good' and 'Good' tend to have had high loan original amount with high monthly income compare to other credit class.
